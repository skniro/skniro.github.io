<p class="Topic_Heading">For Android</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="Topic_Start">T</span>esting &amp; Deployment for Android 
 requires a few preparation steps to work properly. This topic will guide 
 you through the necessary steps and tries to make everything as easy as 
 possible for you. If you get stuck or have any question, please take a 
 look at our support forums.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Requirements</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To test and/or deploy your game on Android, you have to meet the following 
 requirements:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>An Android Device with Android 5+ (You can also use an Emulator, 
	 but we don't recommend it)</li>
	<li>JDK 7+ (Java Development Kit)</li>
	<li>Android Studio + SDK </li>
	<li>Node.js</li>
	<li>Cordova</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you plan to submit your game to the Google Play Store, which is optional, 
 you have to do the following steps:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Register/Connect your Google Account with Google Play Store</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is also recommend to take look at the Android Platform Guidelines 
 for Cordova which you can find here:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/">https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Let's go through the above step-by-step.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Install JDK (Java Development Kit)</p>
<p>You need to install the JDK (Java Develpment Kit). You can download 
 it from here:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Install Android Studio + SDK</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You need the Android SDK to build and deploy your game for Android. 
 You can install just the Android SDK Tools only or the entire Android 
 Studio bundled with the SDK. You can get it from here:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads">https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Install Node.js</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You need Node.js to run Cordova which is needed to package your game 
 correctly for Android deployment. You can download Node.js from <a href="http://nodejs.org">http://nodejs.org</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Install Cordova</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You need Cordova to package your game correctly for Android deployment. 
 To install Cordova, just open a Terminal / Command-Line window. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once the terminal has been opened, you will see a black window (in most 
 cases) with a blinking cursor where you can type in some text (commands). 
 Just type the following command:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">npm install -g cordova</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>and press the return-key. After that, a lot of text will be displayed 
 on terminal window. Just wait until everything is done. Then type:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">cordova --version</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>and press return-key. If you see the cordova version number, the installation 
 was successful. If you get an error, something went wrong. In that case, 
 take a look at the text/message on the terminal window and take a look 
 in our forums for help.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Sign up for Google Play Store (Optional)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This step is optional and you can skip if you just want to test your 
 app or if you don't plan to ship your game via Google Play Store. Just 
 visit:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>to sign up and follow the guides on that website to learn more about 
 how to submit your game to the Google Play Store. At time of writing, 
 it will cost you 25 USD per year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Prepare your VN Maker Project for Android Deployment</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Since everything has been setup now, you can start to build your game 
 for Android! Make sure your project has a <span style="font-weight: bold;">game 
 title</span> in Database &gt; System.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Audio &amp; Video Assets</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Android games packaged via Cordova may have 
 problems with .m4a/.mp4/.mp3/.aac audio and .mp4 video formats. To be 
 safe, you should use .ogg &amp; .wav for Audio and .webm,for Video. Make 
 sure that you convert all your audio and video files into the necessary 
 format. VN Maker allows you to import the same file multiple times with 
 a different format and then automatically chooses the right format at 
 runtime which is useful for HTML5 Webbrowser Games. However, if you plan 
 to ship your game offline over the Play Store or just as APK download, 
 you should delete any unused files to reduce file size.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Project Preferences (Signing &amp; Play Store)</p>
<p>If you just want to internally test your app on Android, you can skip 
 the following step. Otherwise, you need to open <a href="Project_Preferences.htm">Project 
 Preferences</a> and navigate to the Android Deployment tab.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><img src="AndroidDeployment.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:600px;" border="0" /></p>
<p>(The displayed data is not real and just to give you and example about 
 what kind of data you have to input here).</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You need to specify your keystore information to sign the APK properly. 
 Otherwise it will be signed with a development-certificate. You can ignore 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">License Key</span><span> and </span><span 
	 style="font-weight: bold;">Use APK Expansion File</span><span> if 
 you don't want to submit your APK to Play Store. Also, make sure to enter 
 a unique </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Game ID</span><span> 
 on </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span><span> tab</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once you have entered all the necessary information, click the Close 
 button and save your project.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Testing on Android</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you want to do a quick play-test on Android, just connect your device 
 to your computer and make sure it stays unlocked/active. Make sure the 
 Developer Mode is enabled on your device. Check the Settings app on your 
 Android device to enable Developer Mode and the execution of unsigned 
 APKs.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Next choose Build For &gt; Android (Cordova) from The Menubar to build 
 your game for Android. The build-process will take a few minutes. After 
 the build-process is done, open the Debug Console via Tools &gt; Debug 
 Console and check for any errors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can find the <span style="font-weight: bold;">.apk</span> file inside 
 the build-folder of your project: </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;project-folder&gt;/build/&lt;project-name&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/&lt;project-name&gt;.apk</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>if you want to install it manually.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now you can play your game on your connected device by choosing Play 
 On &gt; Android (Cordova) from The Menubar. You game-build will be transfered 
 and installed to your connected device which might take a few minutes 
 and then start automatically. Check Debug Console for any errors. If you 
 game doesn't start automatically, you have to start it manually.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Deploy for Android</p>
<p>By default, VN Maker supports to export a single APK for self-publishing 
 or other stores and also to export for use with Play Store.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Deploy an APK for self-publishing</p>
<p>You can deploy your game for Android using the <a href="Create_Game_Package.htm">Create 
 Game Package</a> wizard. Just select &quot;Android (Cordova)&quot; from 
 the list of platforms. Open the Debug Console to check for errors. The 
 package creation may take a while. You can find the .apk file at: </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">&lt;output-location&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/&lt;project-name&gt;.apk</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Deploy an APK for Play Store</p>
<p>You can deploy your game for Android Play Store using the <a href="Create_Game_Package.htm">Create 
 Game Package</a> wizard. Just select &quot;Android (Cordova, Play Store)&quot; 
 from the list of platforms. Make sure that you put in all necessary information 
 in to the Android Deployment tab in <a href="Project_Preferences.htm">Project 
 Preferences</a>. Open the Debug Console to check for errors. The package 
 creation may take a while. You can find the .apk file at: </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">&lt;output-location&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/&lt;project-name&gt;.apk</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For more information about how to submit your app to the Play Store, 
 just follow the guides on the Google Play Store Website.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Troubleshooting</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you went through all the above steps without any errors then congratulations! 
 But that is not the regular case, especially not if your doing this the 
 first time. So don't worry if you get stuck or get any error messages 
 since those are related to wrong configuration in most cases and can be 
 solved easily. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The first thing you should try to do is to figure out the error message 
 by checking the error logs. Sometimes the error messages are understandable 
 even for non-programmers. Common errors are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Your device is not connected or on lock-screen</li>
	<li>Your device is connected but your computer has no access to it.</li>
	<li>JDK 7+ is not installed</li>
	<li>Android SDK Tools are not installed</li>
	<li>Cordova has not been installed</li>
	<li>Audio and/or Video files have the wrong format</li>
	<li>You try to install and play and APK, which has been exported for 
	 Play Store, directly on the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you get stuck with any error and if you cannot fix them yourself, 
 just take a look at our support forums.</p>
