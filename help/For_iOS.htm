<p class="Topic_Heading">For iOS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="Topic_Start">T</span>esting &amp; Deployment for iOS requires 
 a few preparation steps to work properly due to the much higher security 
 standards of the iOS platform. This topic will guide you through the necessary 
 steps and tries to make everything as easy as possible for you. If you 
 get stuck or have any question, please take a look at our support forums.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Requirements</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To test and/or deploy your game on iOS, you have to meet the following 
 requirements:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>An Apple Developer Account + iOS Developer Membership.</li>
	<li>A computer with macOS.</li>
	<li>An iOS Device such as an iPhone or iPad</li>
	<li>Xcode Development Tools</li>
	<li>Node.js</li>
	<li>Cordova</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Let's go through them step-by-step.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Become an Apple Developer for iOS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Becoming an Apple Developer for iOS is very easy. All what you have 
 todo is to visit the Apple Developer website, which is <a href="http://developer.apple.com">http://developer.apple.com</a> 
 and register an account or just use your already existing Apple ID.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>After you logged in, follow the website and join the iOS Developer Program 
 which will cost you 99 USD per year. Within the next step, you have to 
 create a provisioning profile, register your device as a developer device 
 and download &amp; install the provisioning profile on your computer. 
 Just follow the guidelines on the developer website to set everything 
 up.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Install Xcode Development Tools</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You need the Xcode Development Tools to build and deploy your game for 
 iOS. Just login into the Apple Developer Portal and check out the downloads 
 section which usually is: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more">https://developer.apple.com/download/more/</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Install Node.js</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You need Node.js to run Cordova which is needed to package your game 
 correctly for iOS deployment. You can download Node.js from <a href="http://nodejs.org">http://nodejs.org</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Install Cordova</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You need Cordova to package your game correctly for iOS deployment. 
 To install Cordova, just open a Terminal. If you never worked with a Terminal 
 on macOS before, don't worry, you can easily find it if you just type 
 &quot;Terminal&quot; in spot-light search or launch-pad.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once the terminal has been opened, you will see a black window with 
 a blinking cursor where you can type in some text (commands). Just type 
 the following command:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">npm install -g cordova</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>and press the return-key. After that, a lot of text will be displayed 
 on terminal window. Just wait until everything is done. Then type:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">cordova --version</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>and press return-key. If you see the cordova version number, the installation 
 was successful. If you get an error, something went wrong. In that case, 
 take a look at the text/message on the terminal window and take a look 
 in our forums for help.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Prepare your VN Maker Project for iOS Deployment</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Since everything has been setup now, you can start to build your game 
 for iOS! Make sure your project has a <span style="font-weight: bold;">game 
 title</span> in Database &gt; System.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Audio &amp; Video Assets</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, iOS only supports the .m4a/.mp4/.mp3/.aac/.wav 
 audio formats and .mp4 video formats. If you have used another format 
 such as .ogg or .webm, make sure that you convert all your audio and video 
 files into the necessary format. VN Maker allows you to import the same 
 file multiple times with a different format and then automatically chooses 
 the right format at runtime which is useful for HTML5 Webbrowser Games. 
 However, if you plan to ship your game offline over the App Store, you 
 should delete any .ogg or .webm files to reduce file size.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For video files, due to technical restrictions the video-playback is 
 only supported for iOS 10+.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="SubSubHeading">Project Preferences</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The last step &#160;you need to do is to open the <a href="Project_Preferences.htm">Project 
 Preferences</a> and navigate to the iOS Deployment tab.</p>
<p><img src="iOSDeploy.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:512px;" border="0" /></p>
<p>(The displayed provisioning profile and development team are not real 
 and random just to give you an idea what kind of data you have to input 
 here)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To get the provisioning profile, the easiest way is to open your downloaded 
 provisioning profile file (.mobileprovision) with a text editor such as 
 TextEdit and then look for UUID and a long hex-number such as displayed 
 on the screenshot aboive.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can find the Development Team Identifier in the provisioning profile 
 file as well. Just look for com.apple.developer.team-identifier. Also, 
 make sure to enter a unique <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game ID</span> 
 on <span style="font-weight: bold;">General</span> tab.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once you have entered all the necessary information, click the Close 
 button and save your project.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Testing on iOS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you want to do a quick play-test on iOS, just connect your device 
 to your computer and make sure it stays unlocked/active. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Next choose Build For &gt; iOS (Cordova) from The Menubar to build your 
 game for iOS. The build-process will take a few minutes. After the build-process 
 is done, open the Debug Console via Tools &gt; Debug Console and check 
 for any errors. Look for status message such as &quot;**ARCHIVE_SUCCEEDED**&quot; 
 or &quot;**EXPORT_SUCCEEDED**&quot; to make sure the build-process went 
 through without any errors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can find the <span style="font-weight: bold;">.ipa</span> file inside 
 the build-folder of your project: </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;project-folder&gt;/build/&lt;project-name&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/platforms/ios/build/device/&lt;project-name&gt;.ipa</span> 
 </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>if you want to install it manually.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now you can play your game on your connected device by choosing Play 
 On &gt; iOS (Cordova) from The Menubar. You game-build will be transfered 
 and installed to your connected device and then start automatically. Check 
 Debug Console for any errors.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Deploy for iOS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>You can deploy your game for iOS using the <a href="Create_Game_Package.htm">Create 
 Game Package</a> wizard. Just select &quot;iOS (Cordova)&quot; from the 
 list of platforms. Open the Debug Console to check for errors. The package 
 creation may take a while. You can find the .ipa file at: </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">&lt;output-location&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/platforms/ios/build/device/&lt;project-name&gt;.ipa.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For more information about how to submit your app to the App Store, 
 just follow the guides on the Apple Developer Website.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">Troubleshooting</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you went through all the above steps without any errors then congratulations! 
 But that is not the regular case, especially not if your doing this the 
 first time. So don't worry if you get stuck or get any error messages 
 since those are related to wrong configuration in most cases and can be 
 solved easily. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The first thing you should try to do is to figure out the error message 
 by checking the error logs. Sometimes the error messages are understandable 
 even my non-programmers. Common errors are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>Your device is not registered for the provisioning profile</li>
	<li>Your device is not connected or on lock-screen</li>
	<li>The provisioning profile and the team identifier doesn't match</li>
	<li>The provisioning profile and/or the team identifier are wrong</li>
	<li>The provisioning profile has been expired</li>
	<li>The code sign identity is wrong</li>
	<li>Cordova has not been installed</li>
	<li>Xcode Command Line Tools are not installed</li>
	<li>Audio and/or Video files have the wrong format</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If you get stuck with any error and if you cannot fix them yourself, 
 just take a look at our support forums.</p>
