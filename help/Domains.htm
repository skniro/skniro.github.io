<p class="Topic_Heading">Sharing Content</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="Topic_Start">V</span>isual Novel Maker supports an easy-to-use 
 sharing of scripts, scenes, database entries and even assets via Extensions. 
 However, if you think about sharing, it is important that you learn about 
 so called Groups first.</p>
<p>In VN Maker, many game objects such as pictures or texts on screen are 
 associated with a Number/ID like you can see here:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><img src="NumberDomain.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1147px;" border="0" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>With that command we are showing a picture on screen with the number 
 5. The number 5 is now associated with our picture on screen. You can 
 imagine this like we are giving the picture the name &quot;5&quot;. So 
 if we want to animate or move that picture to another position, we use 
 the number 5 to tell VN Maker which picture we mean. So if we want to 
 display more than one picture on screen, we have to use a different number 
 for each one so we can distinguish between them. That kind of number-system 
 is used in VN Maker not only for pictures but also for texts, backgrounds, 
 videos, message areas, hotspots and image-maps. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The problem with sharing is that, since simple numbers like that are 
 not really unique, if you share a cool and reusable gender-selection, 
 it maybe uses picture or text numbers which are already in use by other 
 pictures which results in bugs. To avoid that frustration, Groups come 
 into play.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>On the screenshot above you can see &quot;@default&quot; before the 
 number, which is the current group that picture should belong too. You 
 can click on it to change the group for that picture. A group itself is 
 just a unique name e.g. &quot;com.degica.vnm.bj&quot; or &quot;peter.usefulstuff.cool-gender-selection&quot; 
 and acts as a group for variables and game object numbers. All groups 
 are independent from each other which means if you show a picture with 
 the number 5 of group &quot;peter.usefulstuff.cool-gender-selection&quot; 
 and then another picture with the number 5 of domain &quot;com.degica.vnm.bj&quot;, 
 both pictures will be displayed at the same time and there will be no 
 collisions/bugs since they are in different groups. It is the same with 
 variables as you can see on the following screenshot:. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><img src="VariableDomain.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:480px;" border="0" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For Variables, groups are only available for global and persistent variables 
 since local variables are already bound to a unique scene/common-event. 
 So with groups you can easily share your content e.g. a cool gender-selection 
 and other people can use it in their projects without any collisions.. 
 You just have to put all your picture numbers and global variables under 
 your own unique group and thats it.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p class="Sub_Heading">How to use Groups</p>
<p>The best thing about Groups is that you don't have to worry about anything. 
 By default, all your game objects and variables are part of the &quot;default&quot; 
 group. If you have any extensions installed, you maybe can select other 
 groups as well to get access to the game objects and variables from a 
 certain extension if necessary. If you want to share your content, you 
 have to use the Create Extension Wizard. During the export, the &quot;default&quot;group 
 will be replaced with your own unique group which is the ID you have choosen 
 in the Create Extension Wizard.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><img src="CreateExtensionForSharing.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:686px;" border="0" /></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In the above example, the ID &quot;com.example.usefulevent&quot; will 
 be used as your unique group name. You can use any kind of name you want 
 but it is recommended to follow a domain-like pattern.</p>
